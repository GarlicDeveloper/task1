# 🧠 Project: Laptop Dataset Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and exploring a real-world dataset containing laptop specifications and prices. The goal is to transform a raw, uncleaned dataset into a structured format suitable for analysis, and then uncover insights through visual and statistical exploration.

## 📂 Dataset
Source: Uncleaned Laptop Price Dataset on Kaggle
Format: CSV
Features: Brand, Processor, RAM, Storage, Operating System, Display Size, Price, etc.

## 🛠️ Tasks Performed
### 1. Data Cleaning
Removed null and duplicate entries
Standardized inconsistent formats (e.g., RAM units, storage types)
Handled outliers and irrelevant columns
Converted categorical variables for analysis

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution plots for price and key features
Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships
Brand-wise price comparisons
Feature impact on pricing (e.g., SSD vs HDD, RAM size)

## 📊 Key Insights
SSD-based laptops tend to be priced higher than HDD-based ones
Certain brands consistently offer higher-priced models
RAM and processor type significantly influence pricing

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
